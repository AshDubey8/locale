Event discovery app

## Idea
Build a website where I can search for events like concerts, sports games, etc.

## Plan
1. Start with a basic Node.js server
2. Add an API endpoint that fetches events
3. Create a simple HTML page to display them
4. Make it look decent with CSS
5. Maybe add favorites later

Eventbrite API doesnt allow free access to data.
